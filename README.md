This is my own personal [blog](https://gonzalostoll.com), done with [Remix](https://remix.run),
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## This website uses (amongst other things)

## Development

To run this website locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:
