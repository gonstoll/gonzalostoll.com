# Gonzalo Stoll portfolio

This website is my own personal [portfolio](http://gonzalostoll.com), done with React, TypeScript, styled components and personal UI library published on npm.

## Development

To run this website locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
