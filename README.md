# Gonzalo Stoll portfolio

This website is my own personal [portfolio](https://gonzalostoll.com), done with [Remix](https://remix.run), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Development

To run this website locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
